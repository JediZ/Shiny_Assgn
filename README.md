# Ionic Character of a Covalent Bond
## Introduction
This app uses Pauling Electronegativity scale to calculate the ionic character of a diatomic covalent bond.

The formula is 100 * ( 1 - exp( -0.25 * (X1-X2)^2 )), where X1 and X2 are Pauling Electronegativities.

## Usage
In the side panel, choose two atoms, and the result will be automatically shown in the main panel. Right now, this app only support the first 20 elements in the periodic table.

## Electronegativity data
The Pauling electronegativity data was taken from [wikipedia](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronegativity).
